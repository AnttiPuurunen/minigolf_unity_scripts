# A 3D Minigolf game made with Unity

The game has three courses. It was built as a project for a Basic Game Programming -course.
The focus was more on trying to make a functioning game, rather than make it look pretty.
That said, there are bugs in there, but it works.

A playable WebGL-build of the game that runs in your browser 
can be found over at [Unity Play} (https://play.unity.com/mg/other/minigolf_webglbuild).
